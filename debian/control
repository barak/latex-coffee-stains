Description: Add a coffee stain to your LaTeX documents
 Provides an essential feature that has been missing from LaTeX for
 far too long: coffee stains.  Much time can be saved by printing them
 directly thus avoiding the laborious manual coffee staining process.
 There are four different stain types to choose from.
